    <h2>STEPS FOR MAKING AN INSTANCE COFFEE :-</h2>
        <h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat up a cup of water. To heat a cup of water quickly and easily, microwave it for 1 minute.[5] You could also heat it on the stovetop using a pot or kettle. Heat it over medium-high heat, then take the water off of the stove just before it starts to boil.[6] 
                        For 1 serving, heat 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Use more water if you want to make additional servings.
                        Using a kettle will make it easier to pour the hot water into your mug.</li>
                <li>Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to a mug. Check your instant coffee container’s label to see how much you should use to get the best taste. Most companies recommend using 1 to 2 teaspoons for 1 cup (240 mL) of water.[7] 
                        Use more if you like stronger coffee and less if you like weaker coffee.</li>
                <li>Dissolve the coffee with a tablespoon of cold water. Mixing the coffee with a bit of cold water gently dissolves it.Gently dissolving the coffee instead of shocking it with hot water will improve the flavor.</li>
                <li>Pour the hot water into the mug. Add the water carefully, especially if you’re not using a kettle. Remember to leave room for milk or creamer if you don’t like your coffee black.</li>
                <li>Mix in sugar or spices, if desired. For a richer coffee flavor, add sugar or spices after mixing the coffee with hot water. If you’d like, add a teaspoon of sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, or allspice.[10] 
                        You could also use a flavored coffee creamer. Keep in mind that most flavored coffee creamers are really sweet, so you probably won’t need any extra sugar.</li>
                <li>Add milk or cream if you’re not a fan of black coffee. Spoon dairy milk, almond milk, or another non-dairy option, cream, or flavored creamer into your coffee. The right amount to use depends on how light or dark you like your coffee.[11] 
                        You can also skip the milk or creamer and drink your instant coffee black.</li> 
                <li>Stir your coffee and serve it. Give the coffee a good stir before enjoying it or serving it to someone else. Mix it until it’s uniform in color to evenly blend the milk and sugar (if you’re using them).</li>
